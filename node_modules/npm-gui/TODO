npm dedupe
npm init
npm prune
npm shrinkwrap

`npm ls --json` should list installed packages in json format and should contain...
`npm install npm-gui -S` should save package and save it in package.json
etc...


Modules:
- Show which are installed.
- Show which are extraneous.
- Install All / Reinstall All

NSP:
- better support for deep dependency
